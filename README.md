## **Text Summarization using T5**  

This project utilizes **Hugging Face's `transformers` library** to implement **text summarization** with the **T5-small** model. Built on **PyTorch**, it leverages **pre-trained language models** for sequence-to-sequence learning, applying **beam search** and **length penalties** to enhance summary quality. The model efficiently processes input text, generating concise and meaningful summaries. Ideal for applications in **NLP, content summarization, and information retrieval**.
